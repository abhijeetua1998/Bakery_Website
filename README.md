# Bakery_Website
  I have developed the bakery website using HTML CSS and JavaScript.
 
 I have created a website which is of the topic A Website for a fictional small business. The Website has 2 pages: a Home page and a Contact Page. On this site I have not used any framework or library it is of pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Website is of a Bakery which shows all the products on the Home page which are available.
 I had faced some difficulties in the responsiveness but I have overcome it and also in some of the navigation menu of mobile since I was not in touch with building the navigation bar. Even though it was not much difficult, I have learned something. And there is much more that can be done since there was a criterion to build only 2 Pages I hope I have met the Criteria.
